# Homepage_v2
 Homepage vesion2 - Personalized homepage for the browsers. (And not dependent on browser. So that we can access same data in all browsers.)
 
 Started this project as of my learning experiment. Slowly adding things for my needs.
 Intention of this project is to have a highly personalised home page for the user.
  
 Built using Python, Java script, HTML 5 with Bootstrap 4 framework and MongoDB used as the backend storage.
 
 Beaware that some of things are hard coded to my needs. Feel free to update based on your needs.
