# Homepage_v2
 Homepage vesion2 - Personalized homepage for the browsers. (And not dependent on browser. So that we can access same data in all browsers.)
 
 Started this project as of my learning project. But now I am very much interested in it and adding new features for my needs.
 Intention of this project is to have a highly personalised home page for the user. This will be like all in one page for the user for his almost all browsing needs.
  
 Built using Python, Java script, HTML 5 with Bootstrap 4 framework and MongoDB used as the backend storage.
 
 Beaware that some of things are hard coded to my needs. Feel free to update based on your needs.
