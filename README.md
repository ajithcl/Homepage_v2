# Personal Homepage
Personalized homepage for the browsers.
 
 Started this project as of my learning project. But now I am very much interested in it and adding new features for my needs.
 Intention of this project is to have a highly personalised home page for the user. This will be like all in one page for the user for his almost all browsing needs.
  
 Built using Python, Java script, HTML 5 with Bootstrap 4 framework and MongoDB used as the backend storage.
 
 Beaware that some of things are hard coded to my needs. Feel free to update based on your needs.
